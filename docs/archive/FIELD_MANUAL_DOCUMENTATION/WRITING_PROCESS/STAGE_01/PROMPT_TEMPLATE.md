# YOUR ASSIGNMENT: Generate This Part Only

You are generating content for the following part:

```json
[CHAPTER_JSON_PLACEHOLDER]
```

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**:

You are generating content ONLY for the part specified in the JSON above. The Table of Contents in the system prompt is provided solely for context — to help you maintain coherence, avoid repetition, and reference related chapters appropriately.

Do not generate content for any other part.

---

## BEGIN GENERATION

Generate the complete content for this part following all specifications in the system prompt.

**Remember**:

- Start immediately with `## Part [N]: [Title]` - no preamble
- Write in first-person, diary-style prose that flows when read aloud
- Include emotional context (frustration, breakthroughs, doubt, relief)
- Capture the _why_ behind decisions, not implementation details
- End cleanly at the natural stopping point - no meta-commentary
- Be comprehensive - do justice to each key moment and the emotional arc
- NO code blocks, NO bullet lists, NO technical minutiae - prose only
