## Next Session Agenda: Design the LLM Persona

### **The Persona Must Define:**

1. **Role & Mission**
   - Writing a technical memoir/narrative chronicle
   - Audience: Your future self
   - Purpose: Capture the thinking and experience of Nov 18-27, 2025

2. **Input Materials (The 7 Documents)**
   - `inception.md` - The genesis vision
   - `swot_risk.md` - The debugging breakthrough
   - `feedback.md` - The validation climax
   - Git log (condensed) - Objective timeline
   - Process Documentation Master Summary - Comprehensive chronicle
   - Session 7 Addendum - GCLI integration details
   - Session 9 Addendum - Adversarial validation details
   - **How to think about them:** Which docs matter for which parts of the story

3. **Style & Tone Guidelines**
   - Diary-style prose that flows naturally when read aloud
   - Reflective, honest about frustrations and breakthroughs
   - Captures emotional arc (frustration → insight → relief)
   - NOT academic/formal - more like a technical memoir
   - Specific tone markers/examples

4. **Content Rules (What to Include/Exclude)**
   - ✅ Thinking process, decisions, why things happened
   - ✅ Key moments and turning points
   - ✅ Emotional context (when relevant)
   - ❌ Implementation details (code, formulas, test numbers)
   - ❌ Technical minutiae unless illustrative
   - ❌ Excessive jargon

5. **Output Format (Critical for Stitching)**
   - **Heading hierarchy:** 
     - Part title: `## Part X: Title`
     - Subsections (if any): `### Subsection`
     - No deeper than `###`
   - **No meta-content:**
     - ❌ Greetings ("Here's Part 3...")
     - ❌ Preambles ("Let me write about...")
     - ❌ Conclusions ("This concludes Part 3...")
     - ❌ Apologies, clarifications, comments
   - **Start immediately** with the content
   - **End cleanly** at the natural stopping point
   - Predictable markdown structure

6. **Per-Call Instructions Template**
   - How we'll specify which part to write
   - What info we'll provide (time period, key moments, focus areas)
   - Length guidance mechanism (without mentioning tokens)

---

## What We'll Design

**The complete persona document** that includes:
- System prompt (consistent across all 19 calls)
- User prompt template (filled in per section)
- Style examples (2-3 paragraph samples showing the desired voice)
- Output format specification with concrete examples

---

## Open Questions to Resolve Next Session

1. **Heading convention:**
   - `## Part 1: Genesis` or `# Part 1: Genesis`?
   - Do subsections need titles or just flow as prose?

2. **Length guidance:**
   - "Aim for approximately X paragraphs"?
   - "Cover this in about X pages when printed"?
   - "This section should feel like a Y-minute read"?

3. **Transition handling:**
   - Does each part need to reference the previous?
   - Or do we stitch them and smooth transitions later?

4. **Example style:**
   - Should I draft 2-3 sample paragraphs in the desired voice?
   - Would help LLM calibrate tone/style

5. **Part numbering in output:**
   - Should LLM include "Part 1:" in the heading?
   - Or just the title, and we add numbering during stitching?

## Ready for Next Session

✅ Understand the goal: Persona for 19 standalone API calls  
✅ Know the constraints: No meta-content, predictable markdown, easy stitching  
✅ Have the documents identified: The critical 4 + 3 summaries  
✅ Understand the style: Diary-like technical memoir, prose that flows when read aloud  
✅ Know the audience: Future you, revisiting this intense 9-day journey  

**Next session we design the complete persona + call template.**

Sound good?
