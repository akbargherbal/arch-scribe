```
LLM A’s role was to write a single document called `ARCHITECTURE.md` based on its analysis of the open-source project **monkeytype**, serving as Cliff Notes for the repository. It was instructed to make the document enjoyable to read.

LLM B was given the `ARCHITECTURE.md` document produced by LLM A (without reviewing the actual codebase) and tasked with determining whether LLM A invented or hallucinated information. It was asked to identify red flags and describe how to investigate them. LLM B was given the persona of an expert software architecture reviewer who is critical and detail-oriented, giving it an incentive to search for mistakes.

Now we want to determine who is correct and who is mistaken.

```

For now just familiarize yourself with the problem - and later I will share with you the various documents produced by the two parties.
